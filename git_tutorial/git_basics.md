## Introduction to Version Control with Git ##
# Everything with a hash (#) sign in front of it is notation
#this link below is a helpful guide
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

#today we will simply fork from the GalleryLab repository
#go to repository, and fork to your repository
https://github.com/dawsonfairbanks/GalleryLab

#this creates a copy to your repositories and won't edit the master repository
#now we will clone the repository to your local machine

#fork = copy repository on github
#clone = copy to local machine

#copy to your local machine by moving to the directory you would like to clone to
cd ~/Documents #moves to documents from your home directory
mkdir Gallery_Lab #make a directory entitled Gallery_Lab to add your github clone to
cd Gallery_Lab


#clone respository with https link from your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/<username>/GalleryLab.git #should differ in your forked repository
git config --global user.name "<githubusername>"
git config --global user.email <githubemail>
git init . #initialize current wd

####Add --> Commit --> Push Data###
#Now we will practice how to add ,commit, and push data
#add is the staging command for git want to use add the most when working with git
#want to add, but not ready to commit
#adding means can work on it
#commit is where you get to unique id
#commit is focal point of version control, where info is being stored forever
#with IDs can go back in time to the old versions you have made
#push uploads them to github
#refer to the guide link at the top of this tutorial on pushing sensitive data, passwds etc.


mkdir example_directory
cd example_directory
nano sometextfile.txt
#write some text and save out
git add sometextfile.txt
git status #see everything that has been changed since last commit
git commit -m 'added example text file' # put in some useful comment that has been changed since last commit
git push

# we have now created a text file with command line in a new directory
# added the textfile to the staging area
# committed the file with a unique I.D.
# and pushed to a publicly available server to be reiterated over

now that we have learned how to use git and github we can graduate on to RStudio

## After each push, you can either set up credential caching for HTTPS access or set up SSH keys

https keychain is recommended by github
